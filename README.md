Pomodoro Do It! Track your tasks and finish them with pomodoro technique.
Here's a todo app with category support. You can add, edit, remove tasks
as every todo app already do!

But with a difference. You can split your tasks into categories and work
on them with a pomodoro clock.

You can activate the tasks by clicking the activation icon on the right.

Active tasks turn green to recognize them easier. Activating tasks means
that when you finished a work session, the remaining required pomodoro
count will automatically decrease. So you can track your tasks easier!

Also you can pin your tasks to keep them up.

When you get bored, you can always skip the work state. But this action
does not increase your pomodoro sessions. In every 4th pomodoro, you get
a longer break which means 15 minutes instead of 5 minutes!

Lets use the app!
